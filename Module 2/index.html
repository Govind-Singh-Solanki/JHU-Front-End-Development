            <p class="content">Apparently, a player has an automatically increased chance of hitting a home run upon hitting the said spot. It sits in the area between 5-7 inches from the barrel end of the bat. When the bat makes a satisfying crack sound and there is less vibration, then it can be said that a player hit the sweet spot.</p>
